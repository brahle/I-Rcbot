ZEC KVIZ
========

This project is dedicated to re-creation of the zec-bot, the quiz IRC
bot. The idea is to make it easy to add new and fix old questions, as
well options to challenge others. 

To run it, you need to have django and python 2.6 installed.

To start, you should use `python manage.py runserver` and then go
visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
